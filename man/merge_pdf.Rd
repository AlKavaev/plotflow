\title{Merge Differnt Sized Plots}
\usage{
merge_pdf(n.plots, file, widths = 8, heights = 8, n.lines = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.plots}{The number of plots to be combined.}

\item{file}{A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to.}

\item{widths}{A vector of widths equal to \code{n.plots} or a single value
that will be used for all plot widths.}

\item{heights}{A vector of heights equal to \code{n.plots} or a single value
that will be used for all plot widths.}

\item{n.lines}{A vector of integer values indicating the number of lines each
plotting sequance will take.  Default is 1 line each.}
}
\value{
Returns a single combined plot of various sizes.
}
\description{
Allows for merging of different sized R plots.
}
\note{
To use with ggplot the plotting sequance must be wrapped with
\code{plot()}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
merge_pdf(3, file = "foo.pdf", widths = c(7, 7, 10), heights = c(6, 10, 7))
plot(1:10)
plot(1:10, pch=19)
plot(1:10, col="red", pch=19)

library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
merge_pdf(2, file = "bar.pdf", widths = c(7, 10), heights = c(6, 10))
plot(1:10)
print(p)
