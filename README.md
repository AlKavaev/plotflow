You can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/plotflow/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/plotflow/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)
install_github("plotflow", "trinker")
```

### Note
